Building Nomos is a team of passionate and experienced blockchain developers and researchers. Leading the effort is √Ålvaro Castro-Castilla who previously held the position of Head of Blockchain Infrastructure at Status and takes responsibility for coordinating research and development, defining the network's architecture, and establishing its vision, values and mission.

Alongside Nomos' project lead is a team of three researchers and developers with experience as software engineers both within and beyond the web3 ecosystem, and in academia. As of June 2023, there are two Rust developers (one senior) and a mathematical analyst that contribute to the project.

At this stage of development, the group of contributors working on Nomos is small, meaning it has a loose, fluid structure. As more contributors join to work on the network, we expect to revise the structure detailed here.

Nomos is keen to work with other contributors. If you share our passion for decentralization, individual sovereignty and privacy, we'd love to hear from you.
